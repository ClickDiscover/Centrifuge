<p>Instead of throwing away precious dollars on expensive anti-aging skin creams that make big promises and don’t work, one reader has discovered a skin combo that erases years off her face for only a few dollars. Read on to find out how it works! One of these amazing products is called <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>, which decreases wrinkles and dark spots, and the other is called <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?>,</a> which eliminates signs of aging around the eyes.</p>  <br>

    “Dr Oz calls it - The Miracle Anti-Aging Breakthrough - <br>Because It Works!”
    </p>
      <h3>Lauren's Problem: Looking Older by the Day</h3><br><br>
<div class="clr">
</div>
<p>Lauren, a 72 year-old grandma from Louisville, KY, is a perfect example of how a little smart thinking and ingenuity can help you avoid unnecessary health risks and save you thousands of dollars in doctors’ bills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most women, Lauren didn’t have the extra cash to try out every celebrity endorsed anti-aging “miracle cream” out there, let alone splurge on expensive elective medical procedures, like plastic surgery or facelifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before trying this simple trick, she admits she used to spend almost an hour every day on an extensive skincare regimen consisting of over 6 different products, with seriously disappointing results. Each product made big claims promising to erase wrinkles and return her youthful skin; and while Lauren followed all their usage instructions to the letter, she saw no real results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frustrated and let down, she considered going so far as to take out a substantial loan for Botox injections, and even contemplated a highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. But the high cost (ranging anywhere from $5000 - $20,000+) and the horror stories of unfixable botched procedures convinced her that cosmetic treatments were not the solution she was looking for. She was determined to find a safe and affordable anti-aging solution that would give her real results and not leave her digging her way out of a huge financial debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Lauren's Solution:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a year of doing thorough research and speaking to other women about their own skincare habits, she learned of two products that were yielding real results and helping women take years off their skin: <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While each of these products were proven to be effective individually, one night, Lauren made an accidental discovery that would revolutionize the whole skincare industry: she combined them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After only a few days of using both products together in her daily skin routine, she saw noticeable results in the mirror. After just two weeks of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>. combined, the proof was staring her right in the face: this was giving her real results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the two products together, Lauren’s results were noticeably better than what you’d find at medi-spas for $5,000 or more. This combination removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin. Lauren was able to see these dramatic anti-aging results simply by using free samples of both products for only 14 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her friends, husband, and family were all shocked. They were convinced she’d been secretly getting Botox, because her skin looked 20 years younger almost overnight! Soon, word got around as her friends starting using Lauren’s method, and not long after, her easy, 2-product trick was featured on The Doctor Oz Show!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lauren is now one of hundreds of women that share the same incredible story. Using this method, she effectively erased 20+ years from her skin. It’s changed her life and completely astonished everyone around her, even total strangers!</p>
<h3><br>
</h3>
<h3>How does it Work?</h3>
<br>
<p>Through her research, Lauren discovered that the real secret to cell revival and skin rejuvenation are two key ingredients:</p><br>
<ol>
<strong><li>Vitamin C</li>
<li>Hyaluronic Acid</li></strong>
</ol>
<br>

<p>These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective.</p><br>
<p><strong>Vitamin C</strong> is the key to maintaining healthy, youthful skin. It’s a powerful antioxidant that slows the rate of free-radical damage, which causes skin’s dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles. It helps combat and even reverse time's effect on your skin, because it produces collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. Applying Vitamin C to the skin topically is up to <strong>20 times more effective</strong> than taking it orally. 

</p>
<p class="pageheader">Dr. Oz calls Vitamin C “the secret to cheat your age”. </p>

<p>
<strong>Hyaluronic Acid</strong> works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation.</p><br>
<p>Celebrities around the world like Cindy Crawford, Jennifer Aniston, and Kelly Ripa have all admitted to using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> to maintain their youthful glow.
</p>

<sup><img src="<?= $assets ?>/cite.png" width="25" height="19"></sup>Celebs have been raving about <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>. They confess that it's the secret to their youthful skin.<sup><img src="<?= $assets ?>/cite2.png" width="25" height="19"></sup>
</p><br>

<p>
Dr. Richard Peters, a prominent dermatologist based in Beverly Hills, California, revealed to us that using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a></a> together is the celebrity secret to youthful skin because both products contain the <em>purest</em> and most <em>powerful</em> forms of <strong>Vitamin C</strong> and <strong>Hyaluronic Acid</strong>. Best of all the products are all-natural, perfectly safe for all skin types, and have no nasty side effects.</p>

Our tests show that you can erase almost 20 to 30 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they’re not all the same.” - Dr. Oz</p></div>

<h2><strong>Day 1</strong></h2>

<p class="testdiaryp">After the first day of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a></a> together, I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel. 


It felt like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a gigantic vacuum cleaner. </p><p class="testdiaryp">I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.

<p class="testdiaryp">After five days of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a></a>, I was shocked at the drastic results.</p>
<p class="testdiaryp"><strong>The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!</strong></p>
<p class="testdiaryp">I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 20 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!

<h2><strong>Day 14</strong></h2>

<p class="testdiaryp">After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!</p>
<p class="testdiaryp">The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!</p>
<p class="testdiaryp">After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. <strong>By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!</strong>
</p>


<div class="clr"></div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Will This Work For You?</strong></p><br>

<p>There are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, and most of them are ridiculously expensive. With so many options it’s only natural for you to be skeptical about the results, and so I challenge you to do what I did: <strong>try it for yourself!</strong> Conduct your own study and see the incredible results in your mirror at home. <strong>You won’t believe YOUR before and after!</strong> </p><br>

<p> For your convenience, I have provided the links that Brenda used to sign up for her <strong>Free Trials</strong> of both <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a></a>  Use the links below and you will get the lowest possible shipping price as well.</p>
