        <p><strong>(Women’s Health)</strong> - Since the beginning of the year, our readers have been going crazy over a new <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank">‘Skinny Pill”</a> that is sweeping the nation and helping people from all walks of life transform their bodies quickly and safely - a product that has been so successful, many weight-loss doctors and plastic surgeons now want to see it banned.  </p>

<p>They are making accusations that it causes people to get lean too quickly and should be regulated, despite the fact that it’s clinically proven to be safe and has none of the dangerous side effects that prescription diet pills have.</p>

<p>Since the products were recently featured on an episode of The Dr. Oz Show, we have been getting 1000’s of daily letters from our readers, begging us for more information and asking us how they can get their hands on this new fat-burning supplement.  Surprisingly, many people who struggle daily with their weight have yet to hear about this powerful option.</p>

<p>In a recent exclusive interview with Women’s Health, movie star Scarlett Johansson credits the product with helping her lose nearly 22-lbs of body fat in preparation for her role as the ‘Black Widow’ in The Avengers.  Dozens of other celebrities like Jennifer Hudson, Christina Aguilera, Sandra Bullock and Kelly Osborne have all lost weight and transformed their bodies using this controversial pill.  Even Men have gotten in on the weight-loss action and used the same product to make some drastic physical transformations. </p>

<div class="aside-container">

    <p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/results1.jpg"></a></p>
    <p>“I love my new body and I love what I see in the mirror. I’ve tried dozens of products and treatments but none worked better than <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!”	</p>
  </aside>
  <div class="main">
<p>The product we're talking about is called <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>. You may have seen it in the news, on TV, or trending online as the safe and powerful "secret diet trick” being used by models, celebrities and regular folk all across America.  <?= $step1_name ?>’s high anti-oxidant content and powerful fat burning properties make it a belly busting machine.  Combine it with the detoxifying, cleansing and additional weight loss effect of a <?= $step2_name ?> and you see why this deserves a Special Report.  But maybe the most important part is that <?= $step1_name ?> is finally available nationwide WITHOUT a prescription.
</p>
</div>
  <div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

<p>According to Dr Julie Chen (A guest host on the Dr. Oz episode where <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> was featured) the product works in more than one way, “The first way is it goes in and causes the body to burn glucose, or sugar, and burn fat, mainly in the liver…</p>

<p>The second way, the most important way, is it slows the release of sugar into the blood stream. So when you don’t have sugar building up in the blood stream, you don’t have fat building up because sugar turns to fat.  When the two are combined together, you get this synergistic effect that basically burns and blocks and stops fat, but it also is natural and safe.”</p>

<p>If you’re feeling skeptical right now, you’re not alone. We here at Women’s Health have seen many promising products come and go over the last 18 years.  When we first learned about ‘yet another’ fat-burning/body-firming product our fad radar went off right away.  Even after pouring through mountains of research. While I had an educated opinion, I still had no personal proof that the <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> option was worth the time. So, with my editors blessing, I decided to go out and put the product to the test myself. What better way to find out the truth than to conduct my own study?</p>

<p>We know that the thought of losing your excess fat often feels like an impossible challenge. We’ve evaluated numerous fat-loss programs and it seems like everything, too demanding or doesn’t work as claimed. The reason why most programs fail is because they impose unrealistic restrictions on your daily life.</p>

<div class="aside-container">
  <aside>
    <p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/results3.jpg"></a></p>
    <p>“It’s simply amazing. I can’t believe how quickly I saw results. Real results! I literally saw results after the first day. I can’t thank you enough, I have my youthful figure back”</p>
  </aside>
  <div class="main">
<p>Despite our reservations about <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>, the countless success stories that have poured into our office showed that ordinary people around the world were able to make incredible changes to their bodies without drastic changes.  These people saw results without having to significantly change their lifestyles or eating habits.</p>
</div>
  <div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

<p>In this special report, I explain exactly how I tested the product and show you the surprising results I achieved.  Today, I’m leaking the secret to what, we here at Women’s Health, call “quite possibly the most effective female physique transformation stack the world has ever seen”.  I’ll show you how you too can get a leaner, slimmer sexier body quickly and safely without having to use illegal drugs or paying $1000’s for surgery.</p>

<div class="clinically-proven">
  <h3 id="Slendera-clinical-studies"><?= $step1_name ?> Clinical Studies</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>In a study published in the journal Lipids in Health &amp; Disease, subjects taking <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> lost an average of 19.3 pounds in 28 days (4 weeks) without any changes to their diet or exercise.</li>
    <li><?= $step1_name ?> contains no stimulants, no artificial chemicals and is 100% Natural.</li>
    <li><?= $step1_name ?> has been found to increase metabolism, boosting weight loss by more than 640%.</li>
    <li>Studies have shown a 39% reduction in cholesterol and an average 2 inch reduction in belly fat within 28 days (4 weeks)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>At first, I only wanted to try <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> since losing fat was my main goal.  However, the pharmaceutical company behind the product advised us that the amino acid boosting, digestive cleansing and detoxifying effect of a Cleanse such as <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> combined with <?= $step1_name ?> would create a synergistic effect and actually lead to a 2X increase in fat loss versus using <?= $step1_name ?> alone.  So after reviewing the literature, going through most of the success stories and speaking with the our internal medical staff here at Women’s Health, we came to the decision that I would achieve maximum results using both products together, as they were intended.  </p>

<div class="clinically-proven">
  <h3 id="the-proof-is-in-the-real-world-results">The Proof is in the Real-World Results</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Subjects lost more weight – an average of 17 pounds – while supplementing with <?= $step1_name ?> compared to a placebo.</li>
    <li>On average, subjects experienced a 7.2% reduction in body weight.</li>
    <li>Subject also experienced a 16% reduction in body fat.</li>
    <li>When <?= $step1_name ?> was combined with <?= $step2_name ?>, the subjects saw an additional 49% reduction in fat loss along with a further 4.6% reduction in overall bodyweight.</li>
    <li>The combination of <?= $step1_name ?> and <?= $step2_name ?> led to an incredible 37.6% acceleration in desired positive results.</li>
    <li>Subjects did not change their diets while on the study however were all physically active and exercised at least once per week.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="featured-in">
  <p><img src="<?= $assets ?>/featured-in.png">	
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/newsarticles.png"></p>
</div>

<p>So I went ahead, visited the <?= $step1_name ?> &amp; <?= $step2_name ?> website, and ordered my Risk Free Trial of the products.  </p>

<p>They both arrived within 4 days.</p>

<p>Each bottle held a month’s worth of pills which worked out perfectly as I would be following the supplement routine for 4 weeks and documenting my progress along the way.</p>

<p>The product dosage was:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank">Take One <?= $step1_name ?> pill every morning</a></li>
  <li><a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank">Take One <?= $step2_name ?> pill in the evening before bed</a></li>
</ol>

<div class="exclusive-for-our-readers results">
  <p>The results shocked everyone here at Women’s Health (including myself)…</p>
</div>

<div class="week one">
  <div class="tag">
    <p>Week One:</p>
  </div>

  <p>After one week on the diet using <?= $step1_name ?> &amp; <?= $step2_name ?> I was surprised at the dramatic results.  My energy level was up, and I wasn’t even hungry.  Apparently, this is a side effect of the garcinia cambogia and HCA present in <?= $step1_name ?>, which help curb the appetite.</p>

  <div class="journey-container">
    <p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/journey1b.jpg"></a></p>
  </div>

  <p>I honestly felt fantastic.</p>

  <p>And I didn’t even change anything about my daily routine.  On Day 7 I got on the scale and had to do a double-take.  I had lost 7-lbs, really?!  But skeptical me, I still wasn’t convinced as they say you lose a lot of water at the beginning of any diet.  I wanted to take a “wait &amp; see” approach.  But it sure was looking up!  I now weighed under 130-lbs. for the first time since my 20’s.</p>

</div>

<div class="week two">
  <div class="tag">
    <p>Week Two:</p>
  </div>

  <p>After two weeks of using <?= $step1_name ?> and <?= $step2_name ?>, I started the week off with even more energy and was actually sleeping more soundly than before.  I was no longer waking up during the night and tossing and turning because my body was actually able to relax (I believe this is a result of getting rid of the toxins).  Plus I still managed to lose another 5-lbs, putting me at an unbelievable 12-lbs of weight loss, in just 2 weeks.</p>

  <div class="journey-container">
    <p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/journey2.jpg"></a></p>
  </div>

  <p>I must admit that I’m starting to believe that this diet is more than just a gimmick.</p>

</div>

<div class="week three">
  <div class="tag">
    <p>Week Three:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="journey-container">
    <p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/journey3.jpg"></a></p>
  </div>

  <p>After 3 weeks all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished!  I am down, 2 full dress sizes, after losing another 5-lbs.  And I still have a ton of energy.  Quite often, around the third week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam.  But with the <?= $step1_name ?> &amp; <?= $step2_name ?>, my energy levels don’t dip, but remain steady throughout the day.  I no longer need that cat nap around 3pm in the afternoon!  And I am even noticing that my stomach is digesting food so much better.  No bloating or embarrassing gas after I eat!</p>

</div>

<div class="week four">
  <div class="tag">
    <p>Week Four:</p>
  </div>

  <p>After the fourth week, my final results were shocking.  I lost an unbelievable 21-lbs since starting the <?= $step1_name ?> &amp; <?= $step2_name ?> diet!   Actually everyone at Women’s Health is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to be the guinea pig.  Using the <?= $step1_name ?> &amp; <?= $step2_name ?> in week 4 I lost 4 more pounds.  But to be honest I really didn’t have much more left to lose.  I am definitely going to continue taking the <?= $step1_name ?> afterwards because it has so many antioxidants and vitamins that it makes my skin look unbelievable.  A pretty sweet side-effect. </p>

  <div class="journey-container">
    <p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/journey4.jpg"></a></p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="i-couldnt-be-any-happier-with-the-resultsi-lost-21-lbs-in-4-weeks-no-special-diet-no-intense-exercise">“I couldn’t be any happier with the results. I Lost 21-lbs in 4 Weeks, No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise”</h2>
</div>

<div class="journey-container">
  <p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/beforeafterfront.jpg"></a></p>
</div>

<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong>  Like us, here at Women’s Health, you might be a little doubtful about the effects of this diet, but you need to try it for yourself; the results are real. From my own experiment I can tell you that the results are real. After conducting this personal study we are pleased to see that people really are finding success with it (myself included). And you have nothing to lose.  We are confident that you too can reach your weight loss goals with <?= $step1_name ?> and <?= $step2_name ?>.</p>

<p>Good luck with your own Journey</p>
